Key Insights
The churn rate is 26.54%, with higher churn among month-to-month contract users and those paying via electronic check. 
Churned customers incur higher monthly charges ($74.44) and raise more technical tickets (1.16) than non-churned customers. In contrast, customers with longer tenures (over 24.56 months) are 15.37 times more likely to stay, and those on longer-term contracts show greater retention. 
Access to tech support and lower total charges also correlate with lower churn. To reduce churn, focus on contract upgrades, service reliability, early engagement, and promoting more stable payment methods.
